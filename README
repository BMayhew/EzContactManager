== What is EZ Contacter?

EZ Contacter is a simple Rails website that is intentionally broken in several different places.  
The reason it is broken is so that the site can be given as a test to interview candidates for 
Quality Assurance positions.  Basically, it's a "find the bugs" site that has issues ranging from 
typos to XSS vulnerabilities.

== Can EZ Contacter be used for developer tests as well?

Yes, the code has been intentionally written in such a way that there are several areas that can be refactored.
